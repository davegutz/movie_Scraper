# movie_Scraper
 Tkinter imdb scraper tool interfaces an SQLite database with Tkinter and 'DB Browser for SQLite.'  The database contains strictly controlled movie information content.  The content allows me to know what movies I have in my collection and when I last watched them.


## Browsing and manually editing the DB

Install 'DB Browser for SQLite' from https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/.
I use the portable version and install into downloads folder.  Associate type '.db'.

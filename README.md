# movie_Scraper
 Tkinter imdb scraper tool interfaces an SQLite database with Tkinter and 'DB Browser for SQLite.'  The database contains strictly controlled movie information content.  The content allows me to know what movies I have in my collection and when I last watched them.

## Install for your platform
Open pycharm in top level.
Install a python interpreter as .venv.
Test that GUI_sqlite_scape.py runs using pycharm.
run install.py


## Browsing and manually editing the DB
Install 'DB Browser for SQLite' from https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/.
I use the portable version and install into downloads folder.  Associate type '.db'.
